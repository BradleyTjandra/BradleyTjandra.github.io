              <h1>Bradley's photo competition</h1>
              <p>I don't have enough photos of myself or some of the events I organise. So I'm starting a bounty for people to help me find photos.</p>
              <h2>Dating profile photos</h2> 
              <ul>
                <li><b>$20 (AUD)</b> for the "main" dating profile photo.</li>
                <li><b>$10</b> for any other photo. I expect I'll award three photos in this category.</li>
                <li><b>$5</b> for photos which features me with friends. This stacks with previous rewards.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The key criteria for a dating profile photo is that it:
                <ol>
                  <li>Makes me look dateable</li>
                  <li>Reflects my personality</li>
                  <li>Isn't too similar to other winners</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h2>My events photos</h2>
                <p>
                  I'll pay <b>$5 for photos from any event I've helped to organise.</b> There's no limit to this, although I'll likely only pick 0-3 per event.
                </p><p>
                  The key criteria for event photos is that it shows people having a good time, so I can look back on the fond memories! 
                </p> 

              <h2>Extra information</h2>
              <p>Prizes will be awarded whenever I decide, but I expect to choose all awards by the middle of 2023. Photos will be selected based on my capricious whims, but you are more than welcome to advocate for why your photo is good. By submitting a photo you give me the right to use the photos for any and all of my nefarious plans.</p>
              <p>You can submit it by messaging or emailing me. I'm assuming you're reading this page because you know me so you should know how to contact me.</p>
