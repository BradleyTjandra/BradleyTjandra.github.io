              <h1>Bradley's photo competition</h1>
              <p>I don't have enough photos of myself or the events I organise. So I'm starting a bounty for people to help me have more photos.</p>
              <h2>Dating profile photos</h2> 
              I'll award the following for photos I deem worthy of being on my dating profile.
              <ul>
                <li><b>$20 (AUD)</b> for the "main" photo on my dating profile.</li>
                <li><b>$10</b> for any other photo. I expect I'll award three photos in this category.</li>
                <li><b>$5</b> for photos which features me with friends. This stacks with previous rewards.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The key criteria for a dating profile photo is that it:
                <ol>
                  <li>Makes me look dateable</li>
                  <li>Reflects my personality</li>
                  <li>Isn't too similar to other winners</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h2>My events photos</h2>
                <p>
                  I'll pay <b>$5 for photos from any event I've helped to organise.</b> There's no limit to this, although I'll likely only pick 0-3 per event. If no photos are to my liking - including if I decide the event wasn't memorable enough - I will pick none. It's worthwhile checking whether an event is something I deem I sufficiently "helped to organise" because I think this is underspecified.
                </p><p>
                  The key criteria for event photos is that it's something I can look back on and have fond memories. E.g.
                  <ol>
                    <li>People having a good time</li>
                    <li>Something visually interesting</li>
                    <li>Demonstrating the effort I put into the event</li>
                  </ol>
                </p> 

              <h2>Extra information</h2>
              <p>Prizes will be awarded whenever I decide, but I expect to stop awards by the middle of 2023. Photos will be selected based on my capricious whims, but you are more than welcome to advocate for why your photo is good. By submitting a photo you give me the right to use the photos for any and all of my nefarious plans.</p>
              <p>You can submit photos by messaging or emailing me. I'm assuming you're reading this page because you know me so you should know how to contact me.</p>
