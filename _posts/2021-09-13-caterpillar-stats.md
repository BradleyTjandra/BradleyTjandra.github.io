I have created done some analysis on different methods to create D&D stat generation. The key insight is to use a "caterpillar method" to create the stats, which allows you to create character stat arrays with some randomness, but with a much lower chance of creating unbalanced characters.

The method, and more details of the analysis behind this, is available here:
