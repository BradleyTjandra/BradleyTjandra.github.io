I have created a basic GAN which implements [Goodfellow et al.'s GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). It can be seen [here](https://github.com/BradleyTjandra/Deep-Learning/blob/master/GAN.py).

Two interesting things I found in creating this:

* The architecture I have created is simpler than Goodfellow's, and still works. It doesn't use the MaxOut layer at all.
* It took me a while to realise I needed to state explicitly which weights to maximise - when we are maximising the adversarial loss we only want to train the adversarial network part of the graph, and similarly for the generator.
