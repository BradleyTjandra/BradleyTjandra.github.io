This is my personal Github page. I use this share small AI or coding-related work that I've completed. 

My interests are in AI, stats, effective altruism, mental health and tabletop role playing games. I work at Finity Consulting, although I am currently on a sabbatical to relax and recharge.

My CV is available [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AseybLnVMp4wgtgOL-Iq9buyffatog?e=uhOCDw).
