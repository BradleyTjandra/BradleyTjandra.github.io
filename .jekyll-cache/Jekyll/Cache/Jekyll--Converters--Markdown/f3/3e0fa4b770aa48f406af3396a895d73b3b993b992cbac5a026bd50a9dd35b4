I"á<p>I have created done some analysis on different methods to create D&amp;D stat generation. The key insight is to use a â€œcaterpillar methodâ€ to create the stats, which allows you to create character stat arrays with some randomness, but with a much lower chance of creating unbalanced characters.</p>

<p>The method, and more details of the analysis behind this, is available here:</p>
